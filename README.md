🎬 Netflix Movie Recommendation System
A Machine Learning based Movie Recommendation System that suggests similar movies based on user preferences using content-based filtering techniques.

📌 Project Overview
This project creates a netflix recommendation system that recommends movies similar to the one chosen by the user. It applies different machine learning algorithms such as feature extraction and similarity to achieve this.
The movie recommendation system uses cosine similarity to make the suggestions.

#The goal of this project is to understand:

- Recommendation system fundamentals
- Feature engineering
- Cosine similarity
- Real-world ML implementation

🛠 Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Jupyter Notebook

🧠 How It Works

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Transformation (Text → Numerical vectors)
- Similarity Matrix Construction
- Top-N Movie Recommendation Generation
